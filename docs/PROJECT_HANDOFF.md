## Current Status

The project has made significant progress and now includes:

1. **Authentication System**: Working login with Odoo server integration
2. **UI Components**: Complete tile-based components and navigation structure
3. **Home Screen**: Fully implemented with tiles, quick access, and activity sections

## Task Status

### Completed
- Project structure and architecture
- Authentication with Odoo server
- Home screen UI with tiles, quick access, and activity feed
- Navigation structure (drawer, tabs, stack)
- Settings screen UI
- Context-based state management

### In Progress
- Settings screen functionality
- Profile screen implementation
- API integration with Odoo models
- Offline data synchronization

### To Do
- Complete model-specific screens (list, detail, form)
- File upload/download functionality
- Push notifications
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exomobile.git
   cd exomobile
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the App**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Odoo Integration

The app is configured to connect to an Odoo instance at:
- URL: https://stairmaster18.odoo-sandbox.com
- Database: STAIRMASTER_18_24032025
- Username: ptadmin
- Password: ++Uke52br++

The authentication logic is implemented in `src/services/auth.js` and uses both REST API and JSON-RPC approaches for maximum compatibility.

## API Integration

The app uses the Odoo REST API v2 with the following endpoints:

1. **Authentication**:
   - `/api/v2/session`: For session information and authentication
   - `/web/session/authenticate`: Legacy authentication endpoint

2. **Model Operations**:
   - `/api/v2/search_read/{model}`: For retrieving lists of records
   - `/api/v2/read/{model}`: For retrieving specific records
   - `/api/v2/create/{model}`: For creating new records
   - `/api/v2/write/{model}`: For updating existing records
   - `/api/v2/unlink/{model}`: For deleting records

Tests for API integration are located in `/tests/odoo_api_tests/`.

## Current Issues

1. **Settings and Profile Screens**: These screens need to be connected to the Odoo API to fetch real user data and apply settings properly.

2. **Authentication Robustness**: The authentication flow needs additional error handling and refresh token logic.

3. **Model Screens Implementation**: The app has a solid foundation but needs to implement the actual model-specific screens.

4. **Offline Synchronization**: The offline architecture is defined but needs actual implementation for conflict resolution.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. Complete the settings screen functionality using proper API calls to Odoo
2. Implement the profile screen with user information from Odoo
3. Create a model list screen for at least one model (e.g., res.partner)
4. Add real data fetching to the home screen

### Medium-Term Goals

1. Complete all model-specific screens with proper CRUD operations
2. Implement robust offline capabilities with synchronization
3. Add search, filter, and sorting capabilities
4. Add file attachments and document management

### Long-Term Vision

1. Support for custom Odoo modules and fields
2. Analytics and reporting dashboard
3. Push notifications for Odoo events
4. Multi-company support
5. Barcode/QR code scanning for inventory operations

## AI Development Guide

When continuing development on this project, the following approach is recommended:

1. **Understanding the Architecture**:
   - The app uses React Context for state management instead of Redux
   - The navigation structure combines drawer, stack, and tab navigators
   - API services are designed to work both online and offline

2. **Adding a New Screen**:
   - Create components in the appropriate feature directory
   - Add the screen to the navigation configuration
   - Implement proper API integration with error handling

3. **Working with Odoo API**:
   - Use the test scripts in `tests/odoo_api_tests/` to understand the API structure
   - Implement model-specific wrappers in the API service
   - Add proper error handling and offline fallbacks

4. **Testing the Application**:
   - Use the provided test credentials for authentication
   - Test both online and offline scenarios
   - Verify that data persists and synchronizes properly

## Handoff Notes

This project uses a modern React Native architecture with Context API for state management and a comprehensive service layer for business logic. The UI follows a tile-based design with a focus on usability and performance.

The key focus areas for the next developer should be:
1. Connecting the settings and profile screens to the actual API
2. Implementing the model-specific screens (list, detail, form)
3. Finalizing the offline synchronization logic

All necessary documentation for the Odoo API integration can be found in the `docs` directory and the test scripts provide working examples of API interaction.
