# ExoMobile Development Guide

This document outlines the development status of ExoMobile, provides guidance for contributors, and outlines the project roadmap. It also addresses the strategic question of whether to continue improving the framework or move into direct app development.

## Current Status

ExoMobile is currently a functional prototype with these capabilities:

- Connection to Odoo instances via REST API
- Analysis of Odoo models and relationships
- Interactive selection of models and fields
- Generation of React Native code based on templates
- Basic web interface for tool usage

The core architecture is sound, with a well-organized template system, but there are several areas that would benefit from further refinement before moving to direct application development.

## Strategic Direction

### Should you continue improving the framework or move to direct app development?

**Recommendation: A hybrid approach**

Based on the analysis of the current codebase and capabilities, I recommend:

1. **Platform Stabilization (1-2 weeks)** - Complete several high-priority improvements to the framework
2. **Pilot Application (2-3 weeks)** - Build one complete application for a specific client use case using the improved framework
3. **Iterative Improvement** - Use the lessons from the pilot to further refine the framework while developing real applications

This approach provides the best balance between framework refinement and practical application.

## Immediate Framework Improvements

Before creating your first client application, consider these high-priority improvements:

### 1. Code Structure and Documentation
- Add proper requirements.txt file
- Improve function and class documentation
- Implement consistent error handling patterns

### 2. Template Improvements
- Create React Native 0.72+ compatible templates
- Add support for React Native Paper or other UI libraries
- Implement dark/light theme support in templates

### 3. API Integration
- Add authentication handling for Odoo 16+ (token-based)
- Implement better error handling for API calls
- Add rate limiting and retry logic

### 4. Odoo 18 Compatibility
- Update exploration tools for Odoo 18 compatibility
- Document new API endpoints or changes in Odoo 18
- Test with Odoo 18 beta/release candidates

### 5. User Experience
- Improve the web interface for non-technical users
- Add template customization options
- Create visual model relationship maps in the web UI

## Practical Path to Pilot Application

Once these improvements are in place, select **one client** with a clear mobile app need as your pilot project:

1. **Choose a Focused Use Case** - Example: A healthcare client who needs a patient management mobile app
2. **Start with 3-5 Core Models** - Example: "patient" (res.partner), appointments, medical records
3. **Custom Naming Support** - Ensure your framework properly handles renamed models/fields
4. **Deploy a Real Application** - Take the generated code through final customization and deployment

## Long-Term Framework Roadmap

For the long-term evolution of ExoMobile as a framework:

### Technical Improvements
- Implement TypeScript support for generated code
- Add unit and integration testing templates
- Create a more sophisticated offline sync system
- Support for push notifications
- Extend to other mobile frameworks (Flutter)

### User Experience
- Create a standalone GUI application for the tools
- Add drag-and-drop model relationship builder
- Implement preview functionality for generated screens
- Create a template marketplace for different visual styles

### Integration
- Add CI/CD pipeline generation
- Support for App Center or similar deployment tools
- Integration with app store publishing workflows
- Support for authentication services (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)

## Moving to Direct App Development

For clients who need custom Odoo mobile applications, this approach will be most effective:

1. **Complete the immediate framework improvements**
2. **Create and document a standard process**:
   - Analyze client Odoo instance
   - Identify core models and relationships
   - Generate initial code using ExoMobile
   - Customize branding and specific functionality
   - Test and deploy

3. **Build a library of common customizations**:
   - Industry-specific templates (healthcare, construction, etc.)
   - Common UI patterns
   - Reusable business logic components

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Include unit tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation to reflect changes
4. Submit PR with clear description of changes

### Version Control Strategy
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file
- Tag releases appropriately

## Conclusion

ExoMobile has strong potential as both a development framework and a practical tool for creating client-specific Odoo mobile applications. By following this hybrid approach of targeted framework improvements followed by practical application development, you can leverage the existing work while moving forward with client deliverables.

The primary focus should be on making the framework robust enough for real-world applications, while using actual client projects to drive further improvements.
